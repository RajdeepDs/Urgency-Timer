  Urgency Timer - Initialization Snippet

  This snippet loads the necessary CSS and JS assets for the urgency timer.
  Include this once in your theme.liquid file, preferably in the <head> section.

  Usage:
    {% render 'timer-init' %}

  Note: This snippet is automatically included when you add timer blocks to your theme.
  You only need to manually include this if you want to ensure the assets are loaded
  on every page regardless of whether a timer block is present.
